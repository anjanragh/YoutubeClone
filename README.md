# Youtube Clone

This started off as being a clone of youtube but for now, I'm using data I scraped for tv shows. So you could call it a netflix clone.

To run

- First run

```
yarn
```

- Open two terminals. On one run

```
yarn api
```

- The above starts the api that auto generates ratings.
- On the second terminal, run

```
yarn dev
```

- The above runs webpack and serves the file on localhost:8080

- The code is also running [here](https://happy-turing-0ede7c.netlify.app/)
